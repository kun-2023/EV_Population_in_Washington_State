<h2>Case Descriptions</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s a data analysis regarding the electric vehicle population in the state of Washington updated at the beginning of January 2025. Since 2015, the population of the electric vehicles had been increasing. In order to encourage the consumption of green energy, the state of Washington likes to find out the best locations for charging stations and other kinds of infrastructures for electric vehicles. However, they must be planned economically and strategically. The goals are the followings:
  <ol>
<li>Understand the distribution of electric vehicles across the state. Find out the dense regions and the less dense regions.</li>
<li>Discover the most popular electric vehicles by population and their e-range.</li>
<li>Optimize the possible build-up of infrastructures such as electric charging stations and the connectors of the charging plugs.</li></ol>
</p>
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<ol>
<li>Removed 469 rows containing null values out of 220225 total rows.</li>
<li>Split Vehicle Location feature containing coordinates into latitude and longitude features separately.</li>
<li>Renamed all the features.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
<p>
This one-table dataset is downloaded from data.gov. It concerns the population of the electric vehicles residing in the state of Washington. Here are the features of the cleaned table:

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
The EV population in Washington is highly monopolized. There are 219756 EVs in the state. However, with 50% of the EVs are Tesla. Among Tesla, the most popular model is Model Y, 20% of the total population, and Model 3 34375, 15%. The top 10 manufactures had counted 83% of total. Top 10 counties count for 90% of total, as King County owns 50% of the total, and the city of Seattle, which is also in King, counts 16%. The annual units produced has been climbing in 2018, but peaked in 2023 with 59707 units. Since 2018, the main driven force has been Tesla as the sale of Tesla had exceeded its competitors by a large margin.

<h2>Deep Dives</h2>

1.	Population by counties. In the state of Washington, there are 39 counties, 485 cities, and 219,755 electric vehicles, which includes both full electric and plug-in hybrid. The top 10 county with the greatest number of e-vehicles are shown in the table below. The total number of e-vehicles from the top 10 counties is 201,318, around 91.61% of the total population in the entire state. King county alone takes 50% of the e-population in the entire state or 111709 cars. The second county is Snohomish with 26633 cars far behind from King County. The highly concentrated regions are in the northeast part of the state including King, Thurston, Snohomish, Kitsap, Pierce.

2.	Population by cities. The top 20 cities with the most e-cars counts for 58% of the total number. The top city is Seattle with 35207 e-cars or 16% of the total with the second with a number of 10869 or 4.95% from the city of Bellevue in the same county. Among the top 20 cities, 11 of them come from King County. ![top_20_cities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbfb23ff-102b-45e9-ade4-472a15e3944b)

3.	Population by manufactures. The most popular brand of e-vehicles is Tesla, which counts for 43% of the total e-car population in the state. The top 10 most popular brand takes 83% of total population in the state. There are 95149 Tesla in the state, far exceeding the second popular EV Chevrolet of 16073. As the distribution of the top 10 brands, Tesla seems to be across the state. The most popular model in tesla is Model Y with 45691 units, 20% of the total with model 3 of 34375 or 15% of the total number. ![top_10_manu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23728620-9e63-406c-ba70-d05105a35472)

4.	Units by model year. The annual total number of units produced started climbing in 2021, which is turbocharged by the covid crisis thanks to low interest rate, subsidies for the EVs. It peaked in 2023, and 2024 had a much lower EVs produced and located in Washington state. Since 2018, the increase in the units produced had been powered by tesla as each year, Tesla always counts for a big proportion. Tesla also peaked in 2023. ![units_by_model_year](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc367e85-f6c6-43e1-a1a9-eb126dc3c020)

6.	E-Range. It turns out the top 10 vehicles with the greatest number of e-ranges are all battery powered. Porsche model MACAN ranked the highest with 305 miles. ![top_e_range](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99105ae8-6433-4455-be32-fc23ed5dfdfc)
<h2>Recommandations</h2>
<p>
EVs are concentrated in the Northeast regions such as King, Snohomish, Kitsap, Pierce, and Thurston. They are not only in top 10, but also are very close to each other, so it makes sense to install a great deal of charging stations in those regions. King County has 11 most highly populated cities. So, King County should be given priority. Tesla is the most popular EVs. It should have the most charging station to cater the needs. The subsidies and the low interest rate had fueled growth for the EVs. The same methods could be applied for other green energy powered vehicles in the future in order to spark growth for green energies. The government policy plays an important role in green energy revolutions.
